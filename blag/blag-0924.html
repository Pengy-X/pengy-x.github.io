            <p>Google is more than a tech company—it’s a verb (verbs are way cooler and carry much more weight than tech companies). In 2025, analytics from services like Statcounter and Statista show that Google holds nearly 90% of the global search engine market share across all devices—a level of dominance few companies see, with the closest competitor, Bing, at only 4%. It wasn’t always this way. Before search engines, people got information from books, newspapers, libraries (reading, in its classic sense), something I’ve noticed seems less central in how people obtain information today. As the internet expanded in the late 1990s and 2000s, new search engines tried to catalog the growing mass of information online. Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with a mission focused on delivering clean, effective search without unnecessary distractions. Early on, Google’s clean design (few ads or extra clutter) helped it stand out. Over time, its simplicity won users, making it the dominant search engine globally.</p>

            <p>Over time, Google’s rise to dominance hasn’t been purely virtuous. Though its early ethos and the oft‑quoted motto “Don’t be evil” (first formalized in 2004) once projected a user‑centric mission, many critics argue that it’s been eclipsed by an intense focus on monetization. Today, Google is widely criticized for boosting ad loads, optimizing for high‑value traffic rather than pure relevance, and spending enormous sums (in the tens of billions annually) to lock in default status on devices like Apple’s. Similarly, YouTube, acquired by Google in 2006, has changed markedly: what was once a relatively open video platform has become heavily ad‑driven, with many users reporting degraded service or restricted playback when using VPNs or ad blockers. Some interpret that as a way for Google to enforce monetization and user fingerprinting, though the company does not publicly frame it in those terms.</p>
            <p>In August 2024, a U.S. district judge ruled that Google had violated antitrust law by using exclusionary default contracts and other restraints to maintain a search monopoly. In the remedies phase, Judge Amit Mehta barred Google from entering or maintaining exclusive distribution contracts (e.g. forcing a device maker to default to Google Search) and required Google to share portions of its search index and user interaction data with qualified competitors (though not ad data). However, the ruling did not force a structural breakup, and Google was allowed to retain control of Chrome and Android, which is widely viewed by observers as a relatively light sanction given Google’s scale. Some fear that Google could still bid so aggressively for default status (especially in deals with Apple and others) that smaller search rivals are effectively locked out. The court also declined to mandate any changes to Chrome’s source or open‑browser requirements. While Chrome remains dominant in many settings (including in some locked school environments), the ruling did not specifically address those practices.</p>
            <p>To me, the recent antitrust ruling is alarming, because it underscores how large tech firms can maintain de facto monopolies despite legal scrutiny. For consumers, this translates to a loss of freedom in the digital world—and the real world. If we can’t communicate with other people without using a certain platform on a certain browser with a certain search engine, and without being tracked, and without receiving advertisements at every corner, we aren’t communicating freely, and the essence of the internet has been murdered, by Google, and so many other companies. To preserve the openness of the internet, stakeholders—including policymakers, developers, and users—must advocate for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws, support alternative platforms, and prioritize privacy by default.</p>
